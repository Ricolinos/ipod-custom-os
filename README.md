Rockpod is a [Rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org) fork for iPod Classic (6th/7th gen, 2007-2014) and iPod Video (5th/5.5th gen, 2005-2006). This branch combines MFi digital audio output, a rewritten Cover Flow, an Apple2026 UI layer, dynamic album art colors support, and SSD-aware power management.

Rockpod supports both HDD and iFlash-modded units. Both iPod models share the same 320x240 Apple2026 foundation, but this branch should still be treated as an experimental beta rather than a drop-in stable replacement. Apple2026 intentionally ships with dynamic colors off by default to preserve the neutral shell, and some UI surfaces such as Quick Settings, WPS return routing, and hold/lock behavior are still under active validation.

**This fork** adds a personal layer on top of Poorfocus's work: a Spanish
shell, a split root menu modelled on the iPod 5G, and a set of screens
rewritten in C rather than in the skin engine (lyrics, search, playlist
picker). It targets a single device, an iPod Classic 6G, and is not intended
as a general release — see [Personal Apple2026 layer](#personal-apple2026-layer).

Beta Update 2 focuses on the Apple2026 release surface: rebuilt Quick Settings, refreshed WPS and mini-player presentation, Lyrics-first short-`Select` behavior on WPS, cleaner menu/navigation handling, PictureFlow return cleanup, and more reliable Apple2026 theme/package staging.

---

## What's New in Beta Update 2

- Rebuilt Apple2026 Quick Settings into a fixed Apple2026 control surface with a centered wheel, top/bottom brightness, left/right shuffle and repeat, and new horizontal brightness/volume bars.
- Refreshed Now Playing and the mini-player with larger playback-state glyphs, clearer repeat/shuffle presentation, rounded hero-art treatment, a rebuilt mini-player background, and the restored Interpod-style Lossless badge.
- Changed short WPS `Select` on Apple2026 iPods to use the WPS hotkey path by default, which now seeds Lyrics / LRC instead of Playlist Viewer on a clean profile.
- Cleaned up Apple2026 navigation with restored chevrons on functional rows, a safer `Extras -> Files` return path, and PictureFlow tracklist return that restores the current song once without pinning the list there permanently.
- Hardened release staging so Apple2026 builds/install trees consistently carry `Apple2026.cfg`, `.apple2026_version`, and the live Apple2026 WPS/SBS/assets instead of relying on stale extracted payloads.

---

## Personal Apple2026 layer

Everything in this section is specific to this fork and is not part of
upstream Rockpod or of Poorfocus's overhaul.

### Shell and navigation

- **Split root menu** — the first two levels follow the iPod 5G layout: the
  list occupies the left half and a preview pane fills the right one. The pane
  shows a tile per section and, under `Música`, a slideshow of album art walked
  incrementally from `/Music` with no database dependency.
- **Cover slideshow** — covers drift along a true 45-degree diagonal, in one of
  four randomly chosen directions, and dissolve straight into one another
  instead of fading through the shell white.
- **Restructured root** — `Música`, `Videos`, `Fotos`, `Podcasts`, `Extras`,
  `Configuración`, `Aleatorio`, `Reproduciendo`, each with its own bounded
  browser.
- **Spanish shell** — `español` with its ñ, Latin-American wording, and the
  library names the original firmware used (`Canciones`, `Carpetas`).
- **Rounded screen corners** — stamped into `lcd_update_rect()`, the one path
  every screen reaches, so plugins and splashes get them too. The arc is
  coverage-antialiased against whatever is underneath and the blend is
  idempotent, so repeated stamping never darkens the curve.
- **Status bar** — section title left, clock centred, battery right, with the
  same face and weight on full-width, split and Quick Settings screens.
- **Lists** — no disclosure chevrons, a scrollbar only when the list overflows,
  marquee only on the selected row, and an A-Z index rail whose current letter
  is magnified in the accent colour, with a letter badge while flicking.

### Screens rewritten in C

- **Lyrics** (`apps/apple2026_lyrics.c`) — two-panel Apple Music layout: player
  column on the left, lyrics on a panel tinted with the album's average colour
  (Apple pink when the track has no art). Reads LRC timestamps, marks
  instrumental gaps with three dots, wraps by word without splitting UTF-8, and
  repaints by region so the idle tick costs almost nothing.
- **Search** (`apps/apple2026_kbd.c`) — the iPod's letter strip in place of the
  character grid: a pink bar holding the entry field and a single horizontal
  run of letters the wheel travels, with a blinking caret and the field being
  searched named in the header.
- **Playlist picker** (`apps/apple2026_pl_picker.c`) — a floating sheet over the
  player with rounded corners, a drop shadow and playlist artwork.

### Now Playing

- **Wheel modes** — `Select` cycles volume, scrub, add-to-playlist, lyrics and
  rating. Modes the current track cannot support are skipped, and when a track
  change makes the active mode meaningless the screen falls back to volume.
- **Scrub** — the wheel drags a playhead preview and playback resumes from it
  once the wheel settles.
- **Dynamic volume glyph** — five states (`speaker.slash` through
  `speaker.wave.3`) drawn so the speaker body is pixel-identical across all of
  them, shared by the player and Quick Settings.

### Quick Settings

Rebuilt again over the upstream surface: vertical volume and brightness
sliders down the sides, the click wheel and its hardware legends in the
middle, shuffle and repeat as icons that take the accent colour when active,
and the A-B repeat mode named underneath since it has no glyph of its own.
Numeric settings move four steps per press, because the iPod keymap has no way
to hold a button to accelerate here.

### Fixes found while building the above

- The status bar skipped the static render tree for speed, but `%Vd` — the tag
  that makes a labelled viewport visible — is itself a static token, so
  `%Vd`-gated viewports were never drawn and the bar's contents came and went.
- Leaving the player mid-scrub by any path other than `Menu` stranded playback
  in the held state `audio_pre_ff_rewind()` puts it in.
- The playlist catalog was re-scanned every few seconds while Now Playing was
  open, spinning the disk for nothing.
- Quick Settings and the shell status bar painted the same 20 px every pass,
  which is what made the screen flicker while holding a button.
- The battery strip was being sliced as 16 frames of 27x10 instead of 10 frames
  of 27x16, so the icon was drawn across two frames.

## Features

### Apple2026 UI

The current Apple2026 release is more than a theme pass. It includes source-level behavior changes in the 320x240 shell, WPS, navigation flow, and release staging.

- **Apple2026 shell** - neutral-white Library shell, large-title root view, compact headers, separator-based lists, and restored disclosure chevrons on navigable rows like `Music`, `Database`, and `Files`
- **Fixed Quick Settings surface** - top/bottom brightness, left shuffle, right repeat, wheel volume, and Apple2026-specific overlay rendering instead of the older generic quickscreen body
- **Lyrics-first WPS flow** - short `Select` on Apple2026 iPods now uses the WPS hotkey path and defaults to Lyrics / LRC on a clean profile; long `Select` still opens the WPS context menu
- **Refreshed WPS and mini-player** - larger transport/repeat/shuffle glyphs, clearer status ownership, rounded hero-art framing, rebuilt mini-player assets, and cleaner speaker/lossless presentation
- **Apple2026 release self-heal** - staged builds now carry the live theme cfg, version stamp, and Apple2026 payload so installs are less likely to drift onto stale theme files

### Digital Audio Output
> Supported on iPod Classic 6G/7G

Rockpod is the first open source firmware to support digital audio output over the iPod's dock connector. It handles the full Apple iAP authentication handshake, negotiates sample rate with the accessory, and sends bit-perfect PCM over USB, bypassing the iPod's internal DAC. The entire Rockbox DSP chain (EQ, crossfeed, replaygain) is preserved in the output path.

This works with any MFi iPod dock connector accessory — DACs, speakers, docks, car stereos, and other digital audio accessories built for the iPod.

- **Full iAP/IDPS authentication** — certificate exchange, challenge-response, FID token negotiation, Digital Audio Lingo activation
- **3 MB TX ring buffer** — absorbs codec decode bursts and compensates for I2S/USB clock drift (~44,117 Hz vs 44,100 Hz)
- **Double-buffered ISO IN** — DMA re-arm decoupled from audio pull for glitch-free streaming on docks with HID polling
- **Glitch-free transitions** — fade-in on play, fade-out on pause/underflow, buffer flush between tracks
- **Full DSP chain preserved** — EQ, crossfeed, replaygain, stereo width all apply before the USB stream
- **HP amps auto-mute** — CS42L55 headphone amplifiers power down during USB streaming
- **USB-C compatible** — digital audio output also works with USB-C connector mods

None of this existed in Rockbox before. It required building a new protocol stack from scratch: USB Audio Class 1.0 source mode, Apple's iAP/IDPS authentication (certificate exchange, challenge-response, FID token negotiation), a custom iAP-over-USB-HID transport layer, and Digital Audio Lingo to activate streaming.

<details>
<summary><strong>Compatible devices</strong></summary>

Any iPod dock connector accessory that uses Digital Audio Lingo (0x0A) should work. The OPPO HA-2SE is the primary tested device. DACs, speakers, docks, and car stereos that accept digital audio from an iPod are all expected to be compatible.

**DACs**

- OPPO HA-2 / HA-2SE
- Sony PHA-1 / PHA-1A
- Sony PHA-2 / PHA-2A
- Onkyo DAC-HA200
- Denon DA-10
- JDS Labs C5D
- Fostex HP-P1
- Cypher Labs AlgoRhythm Solo / Solo -dB

**Speakers / Docks** — MFi-certified speakers and docks that use digital audio (not analog line-out) over the dock connector should also work.

</details>

<summary><strong>Under the hood: signal flow</strong></summary>

```

    │
    ├─ USB enumeration: Config 2 = UAC1 source + iAP HID (Apple VID/PID 0x05AC:0x1261)
    │
    ├─ iAP authentication over USB HID:

```

The iAP HID transport handles multi-report fragmentation for large payloads (128-byte RSA signatures span multiple HID reports, reassembled via link control bytes). Transaction IDs are tracked and echoed for all post-IDPS commands.

- `firmware/usbstack/usb_core.c` — dual USB configuration
- `apps/iap/iap-lingo0.c` — IDPS protocol, Digital Audio Lingo
</details>

### Cover Flow

Stock PictureFlow shows 3 slides, uses hardcoded colors, and is buried in the plugins menu. Rockpod rewrites the renderer to match Apple's Cover Flow - 7 visible slides with uniform tilt angle, custom theme integration, faster transitions, and Apple2026-aware return behavior - and promotes it to a top-level menu entry.

- **Theme-aware colors** — slide edges and backgrounds fade toward your theme's background color, not hardcoded black
- **Full-screen by default** — launches without the status bar by default for the Apple2026 presentation, but the PictureFlow setting still allows the status bar to be re-enabled
- **7 visible slides w/ parallel slide rendering** — matching Apple's Cover Flow projection
- **Configurable transition speed** — scroll and transition speeds are adjustable in display settings
- **Text crossfade** — album and artist text fades smoothly between slides instead of snapping
- **100-slot slide cache** (up from 64), Bayer-ordered dithering, 1-second background polling in SSD mode
- **Track list** shows title only — no "1.03 -" disc/track number prefixes
- **WPS return re-entry cleanup** — returning from WPS can reopen the current album track list on the current song once, then gives scrolling control back to the user
- **No startup delay** — the 2-second "Loading..." splash is eliminated under SSD mode

---

### Dynamic Colors

The UI automatically extracts dominant and accent colors from the currently playing album art and applies them across all skinnable screens — menus, status bar, and now playing. Colors fade smoothly over 500 ms when the track changes.

- **Album art color extraction** — dominant and accent colors pulled from the current track's artwork
- **Full theme color coverage** — foreground, background, selector bar, selector text, selector gradient, and list separators all adapt
- **Smooth transitions** — 500 ms fade between color palettes on track change
- **Contrast enforcement** — accent colors are pushed brighter or darker if insufficient contrast against the dominant color
- **Available but off by default in Apple2026** — can be enabled under Theme Settings for experimentation

---

### Storage Mode
> Supported on iPod Classic 6G/7G

Rockpod works with both stock HDDs and iFlash SSD mods. HDD behavior is unchanged from stock Rockbox. When an SSD is detected, Rockpod switches to a lighter sleep strategy — faster wake times, lower idle power draw, and no unnecessary spin-up delays.

| Storage Mode                                         |
| :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-detect, or manually select HDD / SSD            |

- **Auto-detection** via ATA IDENTIFY heuristics (rotation rate, form factor, TRIM support, CFA compliance)
- **Two-phase idle sleep** — clock-gate after 7 seconds (near-instant wake), then cut AUTOLDO after 30 seconds with backlight off
- **Instant wake from clock-gate** — no bus reset, no re-identify (<5 ms)
- **Pre-wake on backlight** — storage wakes when the screen turns on, ready before you navigate
- **HDD features bypassed** — APM and AAM skipped for SSDs
- **Plugin splash skipped** — no "Loading..." screen when load times are negligible

<details>
<summary><strong>Under the hood: sleep states</strong></summary>

| State           | What happens                                  | Wake time |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Active**      | Normal operation                              | —         |
| **Clock-gated** | ATA clock off, flash powered, GPIOs held      | <5 ms     |
| **Deep sleep**  | AUTOLDO cut, GPIOs tri-stated, controller off | ~330 ms   |

Stock HDD behavior: full power-down + re-init at ~530 ms.

Key file: `firmware/target/arm/s5l8702/ipod6g/storage_ata-6g.c`

</details>

---

### Power Management
> Supported on iPod Classic 6G/7G

- **I2S clock gating** — bus clock gated when no audio is playing
- **Codec idle power-down** — CS42L55 enters PDN_CODEC on idle, pop-free resume (master mute → power-down → 200 us settle → unmute)
- **Smart charger detection** — LTC4066 `!CHRG` pin sampled with backlight-gated timing and 500 ms settle to distinguish real chargers from weak USB sources like MFi accessories
- **Charge gate** — GPIO C1 blocks battery charging when USB can't deliver 500 mA, preventing accessory battery drain
- **Auto-poweroff with USB** — device shuts down after idle timeout even with non-charging USB connected (stock blocks poweroff indefinitely on any USB)
- **iAP idle tick** — polling drops from 10 Hz to 1 Hz after auth, saving ~9 CPU wakeups/sec

<details>
<summary><strong>Under the hood: LTC4066 charge control</strong></summary>

| GPIO      | Function          | Rockpod behavior                       |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| B6 (HPWR) | USB current limit | LOW = 100 mA, HIGH = 500 mA            |
| B7 (SUSP) | USB suspend       | Prevents any USB power draw            |
| C1        | Charge disable    | HIGH blocks charging from weak sources |

When connected to an MFi accessory without a power bank, C1 goes HIGH during backlight-off to block trickle drain. On backlight-on, C1 goes LOW to sample `!CHRG` — if charging is detected, it stays LOW.

Key files: `firmware/target/arm/s5l8702/ipod6g/power-6g.c`, `powermgmt-6g.c`

</details>

### Menu and Navigation

All standard Rockbox menu items remain available, but the Apple2026 branch now changes some of the navigation behavior around them.

- **Full Apple2026 Library shell** — the main menu, Music, Database, playlists, and browser surfaces all use the same 320x240 shell language
- **Functional-row chevrons restored** — root/extras entries like `Music`, `Database`, and `Files` now render as navigable rows again instead of looking like dead-end items
- **Cleaner `Extras -> Files` behavior** — exiting the Files browser from Extras now returns to Extras instead of kicking all the way back out
- **Context-based WPS return work** — Apple2026 continues to route WPS returns from explicit playback context instead of older stale-browser guesses, but this area is still beta and not fully closed
- **Track-name cleanup** — strict `NN. Title` filename clutter is trimmed where Apple2026 browsing expects title-focused lists

---

### Release and Packaging Hardening

- **Apple2026 theme cfg generation** — generated theme cfgs now preserve Apple2026 defaults like `dynamic colors: off`, `backlight on button hold: normal`, and the fixed Quick Settings mapping
- **Version-stamp self-heal** — Apple2026 installs now carry a version stamp so stale theme/config states can be refreshed more predictably
- **Live payload staging** — simulator installs and hardware zips explicitly stage the current Apple2026 WPS/SBS/assets instead of relying on whatever happened to be left in an extracted tree
- **Plugin packaging verification** — release packaging now validates that built plugins and key sidecar files actually reached their final packaged paths

---

### Bundled Themes

The repo includes third-party themes under `themes/`:

- **adwaitapod_dark_simplified** — modified with swapped play/pause button icons. Original by [Dook](https://github.com/D0-0K/adwaitapod) (CC-BY-SA). Theme zip available in the [v2.0 release](https://github.com/nuxcodes/rockpod/releases/tag/v2.0).
- **Themify 2** — modified with corrected menu text centering. Original by [Dook](https://github.com/D0-0K/themify).

## Installation

> **Prerequisite:** Your iPod must already have the Rockbox bootloader installed. See the [Rockbox installation guide](https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/RockboxUtility) if needed.
>
> **Beta install warning:** Back up your existing `.rockbox` folder before installing. For the cleanest results, delete the old `.rockbox` folder on the iPod and replace it fully with the one from the release zip for your model.

1. Download the correct zip from [Releases](https://github.com/Poorfocus/Rockbox-UI-UX-Overhaul/releases/latest):
   - `rockbox-ipod6g.zip` for iPod Classic (6G/7G)
   - `rockbox-ipodvideo-5g.zip` for iPod Video (5G/5.5G)
2. Connect your iPod in disk mode
3. Back up the existing `.rockbox` folder if you want to preserve it
4. Extract the zip to the root of the iPod and replace `.rockbox`
5. Eject and reboot

PictureFlow rebuilds its album art cache on first launch after upgrade. This is automatic.

If you use an upgraded battery or iFlash/SSD mod, check `Settings -> System -> Battery` and `Settings -> System -> Disk` after installing so battery estimates and storage power behavior match your hardware.

---

## Building from Source

**See [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md)** for all platforms: Windows PowerShell (`build-hw.ps1`, `build-sim.ps1`, `rockpod.ps1`), Unix/macOS (`build-hw.sh`, `build-sim.sh`), incremental builds, outputs (`build-hw-<target>/rockbox.zip`, `build-sim/rockboxui.exe`), and toolchain notes (`tools/rockboxdev.sh`).

**Fonts:** The Inter `.fnt` files are included. Apple-derived SF Pro / SF Compact bitmap fonts are also checked in for this research branch under the notice in [NOTICE](NOTICE). If you want to regenerate them locally from your own Apple font files instead, run `python tools/apple2026_rebuild_fonts_from_otf.py`. See [`fonts/FONTS.md`](fonts/FONTS.md).

---

## Roadmap

**iPod Video 5G/5.5G MFi digital audio.** iPod Video builds are available with the current Apple2026 UI branch work (Cover Flow, themes, rendering changes). Dynamic colors exist in the codebase but Apple2026 ships with them off by default. MFi digital audio has been ported to the PP5022/ARC USB controller but is untested on hardware. Alpha builds are available for testing.

**Generic USB audio support via host mode.** The current support uses USB device mode — the accessory is the host and the iPod authenticates as an Apple audio source. This only works with iPod MFi accessories. The next step is USB host mode, where the iPod becomes the host and sends audio to any class-compliant UAC device — standard USB-C DAC dongles via a dock-to-OTG adapter. The S5L8702's DWC OTG controller supports host mode in hardware; the work is in the host stack and UAC class driver.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Apple2026 is still a beta UI branch** — Quick Settings, WPS return routing, and some of the newest WPS polish are still under live simulator/hardware validation
- **Simplified hold/lock behavior** — the older custom Apple2026 notification-style lockscreen overlay is not part of this release; current hold behavior uses the simplified/native path
- **iPod MFi accessories only** — generic UAC sinks not yet supported (see Roadmap)
- **16-bit PCM, 44.1 / 48 kHz** — USB Audio Class 1.0 ceiling
- **iPod Classic and iPod Video only** — untested on other Rockbox targets
- **No USB DAC (sink) mode** — USB audio config is repurposed for digital audio output
- **Rockbox bootloader required** — needs an existing Rockbox installation

## AI Tooling Disclosure

This project was developed with heavy AI assistance as part of an experimental personal workflow.

The main models/tools used were:
- **Anthropic Opus 4.6**
- **Anthropic Sonnet 4.6**
- **OpenAI GPT-5.4**
- **OpenAI Codex 5.3**

I am not a traditional firmware developer — this project is primarily a UI/UX experiment built around features, behaviors, and design changes I personally wanted to explore on my own iPod.

Because of that, this fork should be treated as a beta / research project rather than a fully validated production firmware build.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an **unsupported experimental fork** of Rockbox/Rockpod and is still in active beta development.
>
